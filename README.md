## About data sets
We use the [UCF-101](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) as the whole data set for training and validating feasibility and efficiency of C3D+ConvLSTM network we built. The data set (including training set and validation set) of 4-class classification is a subset of UCF-101 containing 4 classes as GolfSwing, HulaHoop, JumpingJack, JumpRope.
